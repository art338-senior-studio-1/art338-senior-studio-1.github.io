    <p><b> Course Experiece </b></p>
    <p> So far, Senior Studio has pushed me conceptually to think of new ideas and solutions to further my design experience. A big thing that is new to my process is further ideation, as well as group thinking. </p>

    <p><b> Something Cool </b></p>
    <p> Throughout the semester, we created somethig cool to share with the class during show and tell time. This particular piece on the left is a drawing of a butterfly.
      I wanted to work on my illustrative skills, so I created this piece with in procreate for fun. On the right, there is a drawing titled "Be The Change."
    this was inspired by a reading we did in class, called Speculative Everything by Dunne and Raby </p>

    <div class="Mtext">
    <p><b> Zine </b></p>
      <p> The zine was a branding project which helped me find a common theme with in all of my graphic design work. This theme is the idea of growth, 
        and I used handwritten text and organic elements in order to get this theme across. </p>

    <p><b> Eco/Sustainability Branding </b></p>
      <p> Within this project, I focused on the idea of pollution in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and brainstormed ways to get plastic out of this location
                      in the ocean. I prototyped a sustainable shampoo with no harmful chemicals or plastic packaging so that the plastic will not
                      end up in the GPGP. </p>

    <div class="Mtext">
    <p><b> Speculative Design </b></p>
      <p> Within this project, I focused on the idea of corruption, specifically in education systems. I created a board game to give players the chance to experiece 
      this corruption, make their own decisions, and learn from their actions. </p>
