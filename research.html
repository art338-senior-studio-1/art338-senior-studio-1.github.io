<mark class="three">Students are currently engaging in speculative design inquiry<br>
  and prototyping while investigating the following questions:</mark><br>
    <br>
 What would the world look like without government influence?<br>
 <br>
 What if humans modify their behavior rather than the planet?<br>
 <br>
 What if our weaknesses are what make us powerful?<br>
 <br>
 What if we were part of a monoculture?<br>
 <br>
 What if dreams held significantly more importance in society?<br>
 <br>
 What if design was purely commercial and always had a meaningless meaning?<br>
 <br>
 What if socially gender was removed?<br>
 <br>
 How would the USA look life / function if it was powered by renewable energy?<br>
 <br>
What if design didn't encourage endless consumerism? Would it still be important? <br>
<br>
What if all complex human problems were caused by our attempts to look towards and remedy future problems?
